A very good diagram about network protocol stack

In a 4 layer model:
 
Layer 1,2 (Network Access) Switches:
Switches:

VLANs:
https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/VLAN_Basics
 
Port aggregation: PAgP (Cisco proprietary), LACP
 
Layer 2,3:
ARP
Nice quick read about TCP/IP https://linuxacademy.com/howtoguides/posts/show/topic/12806-tcpip-network-protocol
 
Routing (in 3 parts):

Check what is MTU, TCP 3-way handshake and TCP window size.
 
Layer 4:
 
Routing protocols:
WAN: BGP â€“ the only protocol used for global routing on the Internet
LAN: OSPF (Most popular, open standard), EGRP(Cisco proprietary, similar to OSPF), IS-IS (just check), RIP (OLD, some older versions use broadcast instead of multicast which is bad, almost not used but simple to understand)
 
Tunneling:
GRE (popular in virtual networking and VPNs, I guess Docker overlay networking uses it), PPP, IPSec
 
Also read about:
IPv6
Auto-configuration/discovery DHCPv4/v6 (IPv6 can work without DHCP o_O), just check what is CDP/LLDP, IPv6 NDP
Network level redundancy: VRRP/HSRP(Cisco proprietary)/CARP (first two very similar but incompatible, CARP comes from BSD and mostly used on BSD flavors)
VoIP: SIP
LTMs: load balancing and sticky session technics
GSLB (Global server load balancing), Anycast load balancing/redundancy (sometimes used locally using OSPF or other dynamic routing protocol)
 
Most critical topics are in red
Next step blue
